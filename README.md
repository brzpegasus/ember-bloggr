# Ember Bloggr App

This is an adaptation of Tom Dale's [Building an App with Ember.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=Ga99hMi7wfY) screencast.

The code is reorganized into `controllers`, `models`, `routes`, `views`, etc. and all Handlebars templates are kept in a separate directory as `.hbs` files instead of living within `<script>` tags on the main page.
